# Windows-Linux Cybersecurity Lab: Virtual SOC environment

## About This Project

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) using Windows Server (Active Directory) and Linux-based SIEM tools. It is designed to demonstrate enterprise security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.

## What This Lab Covers

## What This Lab Covers

- **Windows Server 2022** – Active Directory (AD), Group Policy (GPOs), and Sysmon for endpoint security
- **Linux SIEM (Security Onion / Wazuh)** – Security monitoring, threat hunting, and log analysis
- **Kali Linux** – Simulated attacker for testing security defenses
- **pfSense Firewall** – Network security and IDS (Suricata)

## Project Goals

- Build hands-on cybersecurity experience
- Familiarize Windows security & Active Directory
- Learn SIEM & threat detection
- Simulate attacks & monitor security events
- Strengthen network security with firewall & IDS
- Document and shocase for job applications

By the end of this project, I aim to have a fully functional security lab capable of simulating attacks, detecting threats, and responding to incidents effectively.
